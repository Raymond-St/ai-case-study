 # **ElevenLabs Case Study**
 
# Company:  
ElevenLabs
A artificial intelligence startup, developing natural-sounding speech software.
## About ElevenLabs:
* When was the company incorporated?  
2022
* Who are the founders of the company?  
Piotr Dąbkowski and Mateusz Staniszewski
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?  
According to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElevenLabs, the genesis reportedly started from watching inadequately dubbed American films
* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?  
In January of 2023 they secured a $2 million pre-seed, and in June 2023, they raised a $19 million Series A funding round (with an approximate valuation of $100 million).  This occurred despite the company having no office and only 15 employees at the time.

## **Business Activities:**
* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?  
Up front on their website, they state:
"We're building AI to shape the future of digital communication, ensuring content is understood by everyone, everywhere."
Later on, they state: "Our mission is to make content universally accessible in any language and in any voice.
* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  
Content creators, game developers, audiobook publishers, media companies, accessibility services, virtual assistant developers, and more.  In my line of work I know about them from folks who are building AI bot agents to replace humans.  
   The market is huge and different outlets estimates vary widelyy (Grandview Research says 1.5 Billion in 2022, Marketsand Markets state it is around 3 billion in 2024, and Speachify.com says in 2023 it is approximately 26.79 billion).

## **Solutions:**
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)  
From what I am seeing, it is a combination of many factors.  ElevenLabs' Voice Cloning Technology enables them to use a small sample of a person's speech to create high quality AI voices.  They have spent a lot of energy to support multiple languages.  They have also focused efforts to produce an emotional range that helps their voices sound more natural / human. A friend of mine likes them for the options available for customization of their generated voices (i.e. adjust pitch, speed, and emphasis). This same friend relies heavily on their APIs and in doing my research, I see this is true of other developers.  They are also popular for having ethics and pushing this agenda forward and publicly announcing this as an organizational goal. The competition in this space is strong and ElevenLabs' have done a excellent job of providing high quality, natural sounding voices.  On the front-end, they have focused energy to ensure theirs has a user-friendly interface and it makes them appealing to non-technical users.  Tow other strengths of the ElevenLabs' voices are the ability to quickly generate voice content (Critical for human to AI interactions), and they have embedded logic to make theirs an adaptive technology so it can improve over time.

## **Technology:**

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)  
ElevenLabs.io is leveraging Data management resources, APIs, and websockets for communication layer work.  It is assumed they are utilizing deep learning neural networks with transformers to help with training their LLM to generate natural-sounding voices.  They are also likely using natural language processing (NLP) to understand and contextualize text content and then they leverage advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) to derive voice output; this technology is likely more advanced than anything I have seen the TTS world in the past 20 years.  Generative AI is certainly in use when creating new voices along with audio processing algorithms to clean and improve audio for the human listener.  Clearly they also use Cloud technology as theirs is now a worldwide market,  


## **Landscape:**

* What field is the company in?  
Artificial voices which includes voice cloning, AI speech synthesis voice recognition, and Text to Speech 
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
It his a hot field and it has been developing rapidly. Major trends have been and are: 
  - Understanding context, sentiment, and nuances in text
  - Improving the quality of the artificial voice 
  - Meeting demand for personalization
  - Multilingual capabilities
  - Fast rendering for real-time applications
  - Voice cloning 
  - Integrations with other systems  and applications  
* What are the other major companies in this field?  
 - Amazon Poly 
 - MS Azure 
 - Google Cloud TTS  
 - IBM Watson TTS  
  My team has worked with Amazon Poly.  
  Five years ago we were using other voices and just starting with Amazon Poly. 

## **Results**

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?  
They have been disruptive in the industry by making high quality voices available to the masses - no longer are they only available to organizations with deep pockets.  Their voice cloning is helping lead the pack and is showing what is possible with limited data /input in a short amount of time. Now the big players in the industry are having to increase their offerings and decrease their rates.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?  
Voice Quality (subjective MOS scoring, and word error rate (WER))  
Speed, latency, and scalability.  
User engagement rates.  
Business Metrics are most often revenue growth, customer acquisition cost and churn rate.  

- How is your company performing based on these metrics?  
They have received positive reviews and they have reported significant growth with lower than average client churn.  They have also been expanding outside of Europe and the USA because of their multilingual capabilities.
   Personally, we do not monitor any of these per se.  We support our clients as they ask. When they are not satisfied, we listen and adjust as we are able.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?  
As stated previously, they are disruptive and have captured market share away from the 500 pound gorillas in their field.  Rates have been dropping and services are improving in order to not lose any more market share.

## **Recommendations:**

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)  
This is a good question; I am in the industry and am impressed with the breadth and depth of their offerings.  Everything I have wanted or could think of, they are already doing it.  I would encourage them to remain vigilant and monitor for unethical uses of their platform, and to continue to work on localization and customization options.  In the call center space, I would like to provide regionally accurate voices to clients in those areas (i.e. if in Manhattan, use a New Yorker voice and attitude).


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?  
My recommendations help to move the product forward and in terms of ethics, it helps with their respect and they can help move the industry forward in a positive manner.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?  
AGI - AI bots can eventually use these voices to help them conduct unique and original discussions.  Further improvements on their algorithms will help drive up the quality of their product.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?  
They are right-fit technologies to help ElevenLabs to improve and expand their product line.
